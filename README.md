# Thermal Imaging for Crowd Analytics in Public Areas

## Overview

The rapid spread of Sars Cov-2 over the past two years has prompted a reevaluation of disease control methods. Traditional measures such as masks, social distancing, and vaccines have been crucial in preventing the spread of airborne viruses. At the forefront of defense, thermal screening has emerged as a preliminary method to identify individuals with elevated body temperaturesâ€”a common symptom of infectious diseases.

However, the effectiveness of these measures is contingent on managing crowd density and ensuring compliance with social distancing guidelines. To address this challenge, our project explores the integration of thermal imaging techniques and cutting-edge object detection algorithms to perform crowd analytics in public areas. The goal is to enhance safety outdoors by estimating the number of people in an area irrespective of the time of day.

## Objectives

- **Real-time Crowd Analytics:** Utilize thermal imaging and object detection algorithms to provide real-time estimates of the number of people in a public area.

- **Edge Computing Deployment:** Implement object detection algorithms on edge computing devices for efficient real-time inferencing and detection.

## Implementation

The project leverages state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to analyze thermal imaging data and estimate crowd density. By deploying these algorithms on edge computing devices, we ensure quick and accurate inferencing without relying on centralized servers.
